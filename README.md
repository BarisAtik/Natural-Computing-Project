# Natural computing project

This repository contains the files for the Natural Computing project of team 14.

- ./explorer.ipynb is the main notebook used for plotting and data exploration. It being a notebook allows us to explore our representation in a more dynamic manner.
- ./scripts/ contains the various scripts used in our implementation.
  - ./scripts/framework.py provides the framework for our implementation, handling the reading of nodes and edges, the assignment of metrics to the graph, and the plotting of roads and networks.
- ./data/ contains the various data files used in our implementation. Currently it contains .csv files storing the nodes and edges for our two map representations.
